Optimal JAX wavelet transforms on the ball
=================================================

`S2BALL` is a barebones JAX package which provides support for automatically 
differentiable and greatly accelerated generalized Fourier transforms on the sphere, 
rotation group, and ball. Furthermore, we support extremely efficient and differentiable 
Wigner-Laguerre wavelets, *i.e.* the directional ball, which can be up to 50,000 times faster 
than their ``C`` counterparts which are discussed in related works by `Leistedt & McEwen 2012 
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0792.pdf>`_ and `Price & McEwen 2021 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05518.pdf>`_.
