===================================================================
Differentiable and accelerated wavelet transform on the ball
===================================================================

`S2BALL` is a JAX package which provides support for automatically 
differentiable and greatly accelerated generalized Fourier transforms on the sphere, 
rotation group, and ball. Furthermore, we support extremely efficient and differentiable 
Wigner-Laguerre wavelets which can be up to 50,000 times faster 
than their ``C`` counterparts, discussed in related works by `Leistedt & McEwen 2012 
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0792.pdf>`_ and `Price & McEwen 2021 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05518.pdf>`_.

The transforms `S2BALL` provides are optimally fast but come with a substantial memory 
overhead and cannot be used above a harmonic bandlimit of L ~ 256, at least with current GPU memory 
limitations. That being said, many applications are more than comfortable at these resolutions, for 
which these JAX transforms are ideally suited, *e.g.* geophysical modelling, diffusion 
tensor imaging, multiscale molecular modelling. For those with machine learning in mind, 
it should be explicitly noted that these transforms are indeed equivariant to their respective groups.
