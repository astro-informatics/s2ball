Notebooks
**************************
A series of tutorial notebooks which go through the absolute base level application of ``S2BALL`` apis. Post alpha release we will add examples for more involved applications, in the time being feel free to contact contributors for advice! At a high-level the ``S2BALL`` package is structured such that the 4 primary transforms: the Wigner, spherical harmonic, Fourier-Laguerre, and Wigner-Laguerre transforms, can easily be accessed.

Usage |:rocket:|
-----------------
To apply the transforms provided by ``S2BALL`` one need only import the package and apply the respective transform, which is as simple as doing the following: 

.. code-block:: Python

    from s2ball.transform import *
    import numpy as np 

    # Load some data
    f = np.load("path_to_your_data.npy")

However, for repeated application of these transforms it is optimal to instead precompile 
various kernels which can be placed on device to minimise i/o during *e.g.* training. This 
operational mode can be seen throughout our examples, found `here 
<https://github.com/astro-informatics/s2ball/tree/main/notebooks>`_.

Benchmarking |:hourglass_flowing_sand:|
-------------------------------------
The various generalized Fourier and wavelet transforms supported by ``S2BALL`` were 
benchmarked against their ``C`` counterparts over a variety of parameter configurations. 
Each benchmark has been averaged over many runs, though here we provide only the mean. 
All CPU based operations were executed on a single core from a AMD EPYC 7702 64-core 
processor, whereas all JAX operations were executed on a single NVIDIA A100 graphics 
processing unit. The Jupyter notebooks for each benchmark can be found `here 
<https://github.com/astro-informatics/s2ball/tree/main/notebooks>`_.

Note that benchmarking is restricted to scalar (spin 0 ) fields, though spin is supported 
throughout ``S2BALL``. Further note that for Wigner tests we set N=5, and in our 
Laguerre and wavelet benchmarking we set N=1, as FLAG/FLAGLET otherwise take 
excessive compute. Finally, ``S2BALL``` transforms trivially support batching and 
so can, in many cases, gain several more orders of magnitude acceleration.
